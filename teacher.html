           <p> My dear students, I hope every one of you are alive and doing well with your families.
            I hope that you have something to eat and survive.
            How is life going? How do your days pass? </p>
            <p>How many of you have gotten engaged or married? Do you remember me? Please?
            I was your teacher who taught for many years.
            That teacher who used to get on two different buses from her house to your school
            because your school was far from the city. Yes, I know that no student would forget
            their teachers by not seeing them for more than 415 days.</p>
           <p> But I completely understand that this fact might change for those who spend all days
            and nights locked at home.
            I want to know more about each of you.</p>
            <p>Maryam, were you able to convince your parents that you don&#39;t want to get married
            before graduating from university?</p>
            <p>Sonia, did you learn painting, your favorite hobby?</p>
            <p>Fereshta, were you able to learn new English vocabulary?</p>
            <p>Shafiqa, did you read the Little Princess book?</p>
            <p>And others, how are you? Every day I think about you all.
            Today is Teachers&#39; Day and I&#39;m very, very sad and I&#39;ve missed you all, my dears.
            I remember how much you all were trying to prepare for the best celebration of
            Teacher’s Day. I always loved all the paper and handy crafts you were making to design
            the class for Teacher’s Day. On the last Teacher’s Day celebration, you were all wearing
            same-colored dresses. I will never forget that beautiful day.
            That poem that Samira recited with the title of &quot;Yasmine Do You Sell Your Notebook&quot;?
            was very wonderful and made all of us cry.</p>
            <p>But you all made everyone happy by singing a song for Teacher’s Day.
            The cake that Noria&#39;s mother had baked was the most delicious cake I had ever eaten.
            People might think that our celebration wasn&#39;t something special, but it was all things
            that you could all do to express your feelings to your teachers.
            Today it is more than 415 days that I didn&#39;t see your beautiful faces. I&#39;m also at home
            and cannot teach because my students are not allowed to attend school. Since there is
            no student to teach, there is no need for me in your school and I&#39;m unemployed.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m far from you all. I don&#39;t know in what circumstances you all are living.
            I&#39;m so sad that I cannot teach you, that I cannot help you. I&#39;m worried about your future.
            What will happen to you if you cannot study?
            I know that you all have a similar journey, which is getting married since you are living
            in that far village.</p>
            <p>I pray every day for each of you so that you can go back to school to get educated.
            I pray to God that good things happen in your life.
            I always ask myself, why are they doing this to you students and to us teachers? But I
            cannot find one single answer to it.
            Our lives were simple.</p>
            <p>You remember there was a room with an old rug and a blackboard on the wall. Those
            were all the things that we had in the name of a class. There wasn&#39;t even a door or a
            window to close when the weather was cruel cold. However, I definitely believe that we
            all were happy, and we were smiling on the hot summer days or ice stormy winter days.
            I&#39;ve missed all the games we were playing in our small but happy space. Even when we
            heard the scary signs of the gunfire, we hugged each other so tight that we felt safe.
            Sometimes I think to myself that our lives before last year were heaven.</p>
            <p>With every day passing, I become more and more convinced that those days were
            dreams and weren&#39;t real.
            The last time I smiled was a year ago.
            I pray from the bottom of my heart to hear that you are allowed to go to school and that
            I will meet you again.</p>
            <p>Until then, please stay safe.</p>
            With love, your teacher.</p>
