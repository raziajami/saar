          <p><strong class="font-weight-bold font-weight-bold">Letter 2 – from Homa:</strong>
           <p>
            I&#39;m also a 19-year-old Afghan girl. I live in Afghanistan. My name is Homa.  
            I&#39;m from a generation whose pains are far greater than their age.  </p>

            <p>I remember a couple of years ago when I was preparing for the university entrance
            exam.  
            It was freezing cold, and I would have started studying from morning till  
            midnight. I used to sit outside in cold weather so that I wouldn&#39;t fall asleep,  
            because I had a dream. I wanted to become an architectural engineer.  </p>
            <p>After days and nights of hard work, I finally got accepted into my dream field. The first
            day of university was both very new and very pleasant to me. Until the COVID-19
            pandemic happened. A pain that the whole world was affected by. The university got
            closed. We lost so many loved ones, but then we said, &quot;it&#39;s life”. A sentence that we are
            used to, which mends our hearts.  </p>
            <p>But then something worse happened the fall of Afghanistan. After the war,  
            the country was sold. The new government came to the throne. All schools, educational
            centers, and universities were locked again. It was us who paid for it. Like a child who is
            just starting out, full of great falls, full of mistakes, full of stumbles. This is our life over
            and over again.  </p>
            <p>After a few months, the gates of the universities opened.  Our classes started again.
            And what grew day by day was our love and interest in our classes.  
            We were so enthusiastic. We had our lessons, exams, and projects. In addition to those,
            there were language and computer classes too. And there was also homework. I never
            got tired of all those lessons. I tried harder and harder each day. We were awake for 72
            hours for our projects.  It is true that it&#39;s not normal, but we stayed awake with the help
            of energy drinks and coffee. After getting up from our projects, I could hear the sound of
            my bones cracking. What was all this effort for? It was to improve and deliver the best
            project. For days, all my friends were working with love at the design class. Everyone
            was busy. You could see architecture students whose hands had burned or cut with a
            cutter. And they continued to work with the same wounded hands.</p>
            <p>My goal was not only for myself. It was for my country; it was to help everyone.
            Sometimes we want to have fun without any worries or stress. I know that we don&#39;t have
            a place to go to have fun, and we don&#39;t have permission to do so as Afghan women. Our
            studies were our entertainment and our life.  But they took this from us. They took our
            only hope. They took our lives. Seeing the announcement that the universities and
            schools are closed, I heard the sound of my heart shattering into pieces. My whole body
            was shaking. And only I know how hard I tried not to cry. But how could I not? Not only
            me, but all my friends spent that night crying. That night was a night of national
            mourning, we were waiting for the twilight that  never came. And our only crime was
            being girls.  </p>
            <p>I cannot fly. Not because I lack wings, not because I haven&#39;t learned how to fly, but
            because I don&#39;t have a sky.  </p>
            <p>I don&#39;t even need a very big sky.  Just one that&#39;s the size of my dreams.  
            But I&#39;m a girl. A bird held captive on the top of the highest mountains in a prison called
            homeland.  </p>
            <p>But never think that these tears are going to keep dripping forever. For this bird will fly
            again, above the skies and towards her dreams.  For her rights, for life, and for
            freedom.  </p>

            <p>Homa</p>
