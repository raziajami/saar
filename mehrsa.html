          <p><strong class="font-weight-bold font-weight-bold">Letter 3 – from Mehrsa:</strong>
           <p>

<p>I am Mehrsa. I live in one of the villages far from the city in a poor family. Life in the
countryside comes with problems and hardships.</p> <p> The first and main problem
is that girls do not have the right to education. They [people] say why should girls go to
school? Tt&#39;s enough for them to go to school up to the sixth grade, then girls should
learn how to cook and learn housekeeping so that they know how to work in their new
homes when they get married. I am living with a similar family but the same mindset.
My family also prohibited me from going to school, but I was able to convince them with
God&#39;s help and they allowed me to continue my education. of course, the only person
who had my back was my mother. She always encouraged me and always understood
me. Whenever she had some money, she would definitely give it to me so that I could
buy stationery and study harder. My father doesn&#39;t work due to his health issues and my
older sisters didn&#39;t go to school either and no one was the breadwinner for our house.</p>

<p>My mother paid for our expenses from the little money she made by milking the
Cows. In short, I lived a hard life until I got here.</p>
<p>Four years ago, when my mother suddenly fell ill, I was very sad and worried. My mother
had heart disease. The doctor had instructed that she should be operated on because
her heart valves were not functioning properly. But due to the lack of funds we were not
able to do it.</p>
<p>I was in eighth grade when my mother became sick more and more and we had no other
choice but to find money as soon as possible. The amount of 400 000 afghanis was a
huge amount but we were able to get it by borrowing it from relatives and friends and
neighbors; and so, the doctors performed surgery on my mom.
My beautiful mother my life my hope my everything was alive for three months after the
operation and she was not in pain at all, but her life was taken from us, and she went to
the mortal world. After that incident I was so broken that nothing made sense to me
anymore. She was my only supporter on the way to achieving my dreams and she
always said “my daughter, I&#39;m sure you will be successful.” Life without her
had no meaning. But I had to live. I continued my studies again.</p> <p> The situation was
gradually getting better for me and seven months later a new government was
established in our country. Unfortunately this government banned girls from going to
school above the sixth grade. My friends and I are deprived of all of our hopes and
dreams for our future. We don&#39;t have the money to study abroad like others. Those who
got a chance or were rich enough left and we stayed in this country whose president
even fled.</p>
<p>Oh, poor people!</p>
<p>What is our sin that every misfortune should descend on us?
Why us?</p>
<p>I wish my mother was alive and comforted me with her beautiful and soothing words. I
can&#39;t bear that my mother&#39;s only wish for me which was to finish my education and
becoming a doctor will not come true. This is so painful for me that it has become a
recurrent nightmare for me every night.</p>
<p>Why can&#39;t I fulfill my mother&#39;s wish?</p>
<p>I could hardly get motivation and hope again after her departure. But my struggles to get
better were useless.
All hopes and dreams are gone.</p>
<p>Mehrsa</p>
